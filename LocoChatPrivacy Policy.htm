<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Privacy Policy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>(Last Updated: March 2017)</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As part of our mission to spread good vibes, we want you to share the things that matter to you most with your friends, family and anyone else around you. It’s important to us that you feel comfortable and trust us with your information when you use the LocoChat services (the "Services"). Please take a few minutes to read this Privacy Policy, so that you understand what information we collect, what we do with it and why.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In general, we only collect information that allows us to provide you with our best Services. This includes, for example, simple tasks like allowing other users to see the name and picture you choose to show. It also helps us to keep our Services clear of fraud and Spam, and it allows us to get a unique understanding of what additional services may be useful to you, and all other purposes set out in this policy below.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Starting with LocoChat 6.0, all of LocoChat's core features are secured with end-to-end encryption: LocoChat calls, one-on-one messages, group messages, media sharing and secondary devices. This means that the encryption keys are stored only on the clients' devices and no one, not even LocoChat itself, has access to them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> Scope and consent</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Before you start sharing good vibes, it’s important you understand that by using our Services, you give us consent to collect, use, disclose, and retain your personal information and other information but we will never read or listen to the content you are sharing privately. You can be sure that we will only use your information as described in this Policy.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">Information we collect</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">First of all, we want you to be assured that we do not read or listen to the content of your messages and/or calls made privately via LocoChat and we do not store those messages once they have been delivered to their destination (which by average takes less than one second). If for some reason, the message, wasn’t delivered to its destination within up to 2 weeks, it will be deleted from our servers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Note that chats with Public Accounts are not end-to-end encrypted, but we do encrypt such messages when sent to the LocoChat servers and when sent from the LocoChat servers to the third party (the Public Account owner and/or additional third party tool (e.g. CRM solution) integrated by such owner).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We collect the minimum information required to achieve the purposes set out in this Policy (see below), and you have the ability to limit such collection, as specified below under "Your Choices":</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">(a) Registration and Account Information:</span><span class="s1"> When you use our various Services you voluntarily give us personal information (e.g., name, email, birth date, phone number and, when necessary, billing information) and you are not anonymous to us. That means your name and photo (if you choose to provide them) will be visible to other LocoChat users. When you install the LocoChat App, you’ll also be asked to allow us access to your mobile device's address book. A copy of the phone numbers and names of all your contacts (whether they’re LocoChat members or not) will be collected and stored on our servers in order for us to be able to enable you and your contacts to connect. When you join LocoChat, the contacts in your address book that are already LocoChat members may be informed that you’re now on LocoChat too.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">(b) Social Media Information:</span><span class="s1"> If you sign in to your LocoChat account through third-party social media sites like Facebook or Twitter, you agree to give us on-going access to your personal information on such sites (e.g., your public profile, friend list, accounts you follow or who follow you, your email address, birthday, work history, education history, interests, current city, and video viewing). We may receive certain information about you which is stored on social media sites if users of those sites give us access to their profiles and you are one of their friends or connections, depending upon your settings on those sites.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">(c) Activity Information:</span><span class="s1"> While using the LocoChat services, we will collect, and other users can see, your connection status, whether you have received and seen messages sent to you, if you are currently on another call, and information related to the calls you have made and received; if you don’t want people to know that you’re online or that you’ve seen messages, you can change these options in your settings. As for delivered status and call information (length of the call, missed calls etc.), we believe they are important for LocoChat users and therefore cannot be canceled. For Secret Chats, we will notify the other members of any screenshots you've been taking (so please respect the vibe and don't take them).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We will receive other information (e.g. the content you have viewed and interacted with) from your use of our Services. When you interact with Public Accounts on our Service, we may obtain information about the messages you have liked, comments you have left and also websites you’ve viewed through links from a Public Account. In addition, we collect information about the accounts you have visited and the content you have viewed in order to improve the relevance of our Services.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We collect information about the value added services you are using over LocoChat and/or apps you have downloaded through LocoChat. This includes whether you are presently online, your personal preferences and the way you use that service. We may also tell other LocoChat users that you are using a certain service or app (to recommend them to try that service as well).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We collect information about the games you are playing over LocoChat and/or apps you have downloaded through LocoChat, including whether you are presently online and playing a game. We may tell other LocoChat users that you are using a certain game or app.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">(d) Information from Other Sources:</span><span class="s1"> The information we collect may be combined with information from outside records (e.g. demographic information and additional contact information) that we have received in accordance with the law.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">(e) Additional Information:</span><span class="s1"> We may collect additional information if you access our App through a specific device (e.g. your mobile device’s unique identifier; information about your device’s operating system, your browser, browser or operating system language; your wireless network, and your mobile carrier; the LocoChat call log). We may also collect your WPS location data – you can choose whether to allow this by changing your geolocation tracking settings.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Specific Accounts – LocoChat Out Account, LocoChat ID</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">LocoChat Out Account Registration:</span><span class="s1"> Our LocoChat Out service allows you to call a number outside of the LocoChat registered community at low cost local rates. If you want to use LocoChat Out, you’ll need to create a “LocoChat Account” by selecting a password, and providing certain personal information (e.g., name, email and billing information).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">LocoChat ID Registration:</span><span class="s1"> A LocoChat ID allows you to connect to your LocoChat account from different devices, using your ID and password only. If you want us to create a LocoChat ID for you, we will use information you provided in the registration process (e.g., name, email, password, phone number), as well as your IP address to do so.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Uses and Retention:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The information we collect from you ensures you can use the LocoChat Service and can be contacted on LocoChat. Your information is retained for as long as it is needed and helps us in our mission to constantly improve our Services and provide you with new experiences. As part of this mission, we may use your information for the following purposes:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">(a) Make our service available</span><span class="s1">: We use your Registration and Account information to (i) register you for the App and create your User Account for LocoChat; (ii) create your profile and make it visible; (iii) process your payments; (iv) create your LocoChat ID; (v) provide customer service, give you information about your account, and respond to your requests; (vi) personalize your experience by providing content (such as games) on the Service, including targeted advertising of LocoChat services and other 3rd party services that we believe may be of most interest to you; (vii) improve the Service, including games provided by our Service, and make it a safer, efficient, and customized experience; (viii) indicate which of your contacts is already a LocoChat member and notify you when your contacts become active on the Service (ix) display the name of the contact as it appears in your address book when a call is received on the Service, and (x) sync your contacts with LocoChat running on Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android tablets, iPads and Windows Tablets. If you deactivate your LocoChat account, it will delete the address book from our servers (more about this below), quickly and permanently. Otherwise, we keep your contact information for as long as you use the App</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">(b) Improve our Services:</span><span class="s1"> We use call log information and usage information (as described above) to better understand network behavior and trends (numbers of messages and calls made by users, typical destinations, call lengths, network type, etc.), detect potential outages and technical issues (this helps us notice things like a drop in call volume in a certain geography, a shift in call length, a change in typical networks, etc.) to improve our Services. We may look into a specific call log in response to a customer support request. We maintain call log information for only as long as is needed for business and/or legal purposes. We use aggregate information about our users and non-personal information to analyze our Services and user behavior and prepare aggregated reports.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">(c) Provide Interesting Offerings to You</span><span class="s1">: As part of value added services provided by us or by a third party within LocoChat, we may use your information to continuously optimize and personalize those services and send you personal messages about new offerings which we believe you will find relevant (as long as you agreed on LocoChat or elsewhere to receive information from that service).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sending a message to a Public Account, subscribing to a Public Account or following a Public Chat on LocoChat will allow admins of that Public Account to send you notifications and personal messages. If you do not wish to receive such notifications, you may adjust your account settings to decline them or opt-out at any time from receiving further notifications. We may also use WPS location data to provide location-based offerings to you from our Service or third-party advertising. You will be asked to allow the use of your location data before LocoChat provides such offerings, and you may also adjust your account preferences to disable the use of your location data at any time.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">(d) Process Your Payments</span><span class="s1">: We may use your Information to process your payments for our Services through a third-party service provider and, on an aggregate basis to determine charges for our carriers and other service providers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">(e) Prevent Fraud &amp; Spam; enforcement of law</span><span class="s1">: We may use your information to prevent, detect, and investigate fraud, security breaches, potentially prohibited or illegal activities, protect our trademarks and enforce our <a href="http://www.viber.com/en/viber-terms-use"><span class="s4">Terms of Use</span></a>. This may include URLs included in messages, which were reported as SPAM by other Users, or were otherwise suspected to be unsolicited</span><span class="s5">.</span><span class="s1"> We may use your information and call log information to comply with applicable laws.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">(f) Communicate With You</span><span class="s1">: We may use your information to contact you (via message or other means) to maintain the App, including your LocoChat Out User Account, to comply with your stated communication preferences or to provide updates about other LocoChat services.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Unless otherwise specified, we retain information as long as it is necessary and relevant for us to achieve the purposes referred to above or to enable us to comply with our legal data protection retention obligations. You consent to our retention of your video viewing tracking data for as long as permissible under applicable law – up to one year after you close your account or otherwise withdraw consent for video tracking.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Disclosure:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We want you to know that we do not sell your personal information. We only share your personal information with third-parties outside of LocoChat, for the purposes listed above, in the following circumstances:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">(a) The LocoChat Corporate Family: </span><span class="s1">We may share the information we collect about you with the LocoChat corporate family, including our parent company, Rakuten Inc. (To learn more about Rakuten Inc., which is a publicly traded company in Japan, please follow this link: <a href="http://global.rakuten.com/corp/about/"><span class="s4">http://global.rakuten.com/corp/about/</span></a>), and its and our affiliates and subsidiaries. The information may be disclosed to: (i) provide joint content and our services (e.g., registration, coordination of membership accounts between the LocoChat corporate family, transactions, analytics and customer support); (ii) help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts, violations of our policies, fraud and/or data security breaches.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">(b) App Providers and Other Third-Parties:</span><span class="s1"> We may disclose your information to service providers and other third-parties under contract who help with providing you our Services or other services provided by third-parties via our Services (such as, but not limited to, fraud and spam investigations, payment processing, site analytics and operations, providing special partnership features in our service, advertising – either on an aggregate non identifiable basis, or using unique identifier which can't trace back to you). They are required to secure the data they receive, so that your personal information is guarded.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">(c) Other Entities with Your Consent: </span><span class="s1">We may disclose your information to other third- parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information within the use of integrated services (or about whom you are otherwise explicitly notified and consent to when using a specific service). On the Service, you may have opportunities to express interest in or register for other services. If you do, we will provide information about you to those third-parties, or parties working on their behalf, to implement your request. The transferred data will be governed by third party’s privacy policy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">(d) Legal and Law Enforcement</span><span class="s1">: We may disclose your information to law enforcement, governmental agencies, or authorized third-parties, in response to a verified request relating to terror acts, criminal investigations or alleged illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other LocoChat user to legal liability.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">(e) </span><span class="s3">Change of Control – New Owners</span><span class="s1">: We may share your information with another business entity, if we plan to merge with or be acquired by that business, or are involved in a transaction with similar financial effect. In such a situation we would make reasonable efforts to request that the new combined entity or other structure follow this Policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information was intended to be used differently, we would ask the new entity to provide you with prior notice.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Information You Share Publicly</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Some of our Services allow you to share information with others on a public basis. If you post information on a public feature of our Services or through social media sites, plug-ins or other applications, don’t forget this information is public on our Services and, depending upon your privacy settings, may also become public on the Internet. We can’t prevent or control further use of this information so please make sure you only post information that you’re happy to be seen publicly. We may also further use such public information you share, for various reasons, such as improving our service and providing you with relevant content, and analyzing trends.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You can control what data you share through privacy settings available on some social media sites. Please refer to those third-party sites’ privacy policies and terms of use to learn more about their privacy practices, as we don’t control these.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At this stage, whatever you share publicly is available to the entire LocoChat community. If you wish to remove a certain piece of content you have shared in the past, you can do that by deleting that content. It will be removed from our services but may remain on local devices of some users (assuming they have chosen to save it).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Your Choices</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We want you to have control over how you communicate. That’s why, for example, we allow you to delete messages even after they have been sent (it will be deleted for you, your friend and our service). How cool is that? You can also control your privacy settings within the App to change the visibility of your online status or prevent other users from knowing which LocoChat apps and games you are using. You can disable the "seen" notification so that other users don’t know whether you’ve read a message yet. You can choose not to share your photo, opt not to receive location-based messages along with many other additional options, which are available within the app.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Every now and then, LocoChat may send you notifications about administration and operation of the Service (for example, about your transactions, policy changes, technical issues, etc.). We may also send notifications about offerings by LocoChat or third-parties, that we think may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive such notifications, you may adjust your system settings to decline them (if you're using iOS systems) or opt-out at any time from receiving further notifications by not using our service.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Cookies and Tracking Technologies</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When you visit the App and/or our Website, we and our business partners may use cookies and other tracking technologies for a variety of purposes. These help to enhance your online experience, for example, by remembering your log-in status and viewing preferences from a previous use of our App when you return later. If you block cookies and tracking technologies you may not be able to access certain portions of our App. You may browse our site without telling us who you are, and we will obtain information about your computer or device (e.g., IP addresses) for the purpose of monitoring and improving our site and Services.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Here are a few additional important things you should know about our use of tracking technologies (e.g., cookies, HTML-5 stored technologies):</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><span class="s6"></span><span class="s1">We ask for your prior consent to use cookies and tracking technologies policies when you join the App</span></li>
  <li class="li6"><span class="s6"></span><span class="s1">We offer certain features that are available only through the use of tracking technologies.</span></li>
  <li class="li6"><span class="s6"></span><span class="s1">We use both session and persistent tracking technologies. Tracking technologies (e.g., cookies) can either be persistent (i.e. they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e. they last only until you close your browser, or until you exit the App). You are always free to decline tracking technologies if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of the App and Website. We suggest you refer to the help section of your browser, browser extensions, or installed applications for instructions on blocking, deleting, or disabling tracking technologies such as cookies.</span></li>
  <li class="li6"><span class="s6"></span><span class="s1">We encode and protect the tracking technologies that LocoChat sets so that only we can interpret the information stored in them.</span></li>
  <li class="li6"><span class="s6"></span><span class="s1">You may come across tracking technologies/cookies from our <a href="https://www.viber.com/cookies-and-tracking#services"><span class="s4">third-party service providers</span></a> that we have allowed on our App to assist us with various aspects of our App operations and services, such as Google Analytics.</span></li>
  <li class="li6"><span class="s6"></span><span class="s1">You also may encounter tracking technologies from third-parties on certain pages of websites that we do not control and have not authorized. (For example, if you view a web page created by another user, there may be a cookie placed by that web page.)</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For more information about the use of cookies and similar technology on our App, please take a look at our <a href="https://www.viber.com/cookies-and-tracking"><span class="s4">Cookies and Tracking Technologies Policy</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Accessing, Reviewing, and Changing Your Personal Information</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As a registered member, you can review and change personal information at any time by accessing your account on the App. Please be sure to update your personal information promptly if it changes or becomes inaccurate. We may retain some information from closed accounts so that we can comply with law, prevent fraud, assist with investigations, resolve disputes, analyze, or troubleshoot programs, enforce our Terms of Use, or take other actions permitted by law. Likewise, if your account or membership is terminated or suspended, we may maintain some information to prevent you from re-registering.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Specific Location Practices: California, EU residents</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span><span class="s3">California Privacy Rights</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Residents of the State of California can request a list of all third-parties to which our App has disclosed certain personal information (as defined by California law) during the preceding year for those third-parties’ direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and want such a list, please contact us at <a href="mailto:CaliforniaRequest@viber.com"><span class="s4">CaliforniaRequest@LocoChat.com.</span></a> For all requests, please ensure you put the statement “Your California Privacy Rights” in the body of your request, as well as your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. In the body of your request, please provide enough information for us to determine if this applies to you. You need to attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response. Please note that we will not accept requests via the telephone, mail, or by facsimile, and we are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or that do not have complete information. LocoChat does not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">EU Privacy Rights</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you are resident in the European Economic Area, you may have certain rights, in accordance with applicable laws, concerning your personal data, including the right to request to access your personal data; to have your personal data corrected or erased or restricted; and the right to object to the use of your personal data for marketing purposes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">LocoChat Land Privacy Rights</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you made LocoChat to be your daily choice for connecting and sharing, make sure to be sending good vibes and make your friends smile. Eventually, this is what LocoChat is for.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Third-Party websites:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our app may contain links to other third-party websites or you may access Apps from a third- party site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these third-party sites.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Western Union Partnership</span><span class="s1">: You may use LocoChat to request Western Union to make wire transfers. If you use the "Send Money" Western Union functionality of the Services you agree that we may receive certain personal information from Western Union (e.g. your address), and we will save information about the money you’ve sent (including amount sent, identity of the recipient etc.). any links to Western Union services will be governed by the applicable local Western Union’s privacy policy and terms of use.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Wallet One Partnership:</span><span class="s1"> You may use LocoChat to request Wallet One to complete purchases using the LocoChat App. If you use the Wallet One functionality of the Services you agree that we may receive certain personal information from Wallet One (e.g certain transactions you complete) and we will save information about the transactions you make (including  your account balance, name and phone number of receiver, amount transferred, date, details of merchant (if relevant)). Any links to Wallet One services will be governed by Wallet One's privacy Policy and terms of use.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Security</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We know that security is important to our users and we care about the security of your information. We maintain technical, physical, and administrative security measures to protect the security of your personal information against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or alteration. Some of the safeguards we use include firewalls, data encryption, physical access controls to our data centers and information access authorization controls. We need your help too: it is your responsibility to make sure that your personal information is accurate and that your password(s) and account registration information are secure and not shared with third-parties.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Children’s Privacy</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our Services are not intended for children under the age of 13. Therefore we do not knowingly collect personal information via our websites, applications, services, or tools from anyone under 13.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">International Transfer</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">8. Charges for LocoChat Out Service and Other Products or Features.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">8.1 Calling non-LocoChat phone numbers and premium rate numbers with LocoChat Credit:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">8.1.1 The rates for calling landlines and mobile phones outside of the LocoChat community consist of a per-minute rate as set out on <a href="http://account.viber.com/"><span class="s4">http://account.LocoChat.com/</span></a>. After a 4-hour call duration, the call will be disconnected and require a re-dial.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">8.1.2 LocoChat may change the rates for calling phones at any time without notice to you by posting such change at <a href="http://account.viber.com/"><span class="s4">http://account.LocoChat.com/</span></a>. The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published. Please check the latest rates before you make your call. If you do not accept the new rates, do not make your call.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">8.1.3 The duration of a call shall be based on one-minute increments. Fractions of minutes will be rounded up to the next minute. At the end of a call, fractional cent charges will be rounded up or down to the nearest whole cent. For example a total call at a price of €0.034 will be rounded to €0.03. During the call, charges incurred will be deducted automatically from the LocoChat Credit balance in your User Account.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">8.2 The charges for other LocoChat products or features will be confirmed to you before you complete a purchase from LocoChat. LocoChat may change the prices of such products at any time without any notice to you.

The new prices will apply to your next purchase after the new prices have been published.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">8.3 From time to time, LocoChat may offer products or features available at no charge for a trial period, at LocoChat's sole discretion, including as to duration and scope of no charge offers. However, LocoChat reserves the right to charge you for such products (at the normal rate) in the event that LocoChat determines (in its reasonable discretion) that you are abusing the terms of the offer, including if you are using any service, proxy or other device or anonymous IP address that prevents us from locating you.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">8.4 LocoChat may collect VAT or other indirect taxes at the applicable rate for the particular country (as per applicable tax rules) at the time of purchase of LocoChat Credit or at the time you use the LocoChat Credit.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">8.5 Using the Service on mobile applications will use some of the data allowance available on the data package to which you have subscribed with your mobile network operator as the case may be. Out-of-country usage may in any event lead to significantly higher costs than regular usage, and you are solely responsible for keeping yourself informed and paying for possible roaming and other applicable charges levied by your mobile network operator.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">9. Payments; Refunds. You can find information about payments, credits and refunds in our <a href="https://www.viber.com/viber-payments-policy"><span class="s4">Payments policy</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">9.1 You can purchase credits ("LocoChat Credit") using any payment method made available to you by LocoChat from time to time. The LocoChat Credit that you purchase will be applied to your User Account at the time of purchase. We will send you an acknowledgement of your order of LocoChat Credit [by email]. We use the services of third parties to process your payments and we require that these third parties take the appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect your personal data and traffic data and to comply with relevant laws. Please review the terms of use and privacy policies of those third parties before providing your banking or payment information. You agree that you are not relying on the future availability of any feature or product offered through the Service in agreeing to or making payments hereunder. You can change your payment method and billing information by logging into your LocoChat account at <a href="http://account.viber.com/"><span class="s4">http://account.LocoChat.com/</span></a>. You agree that LocoChat may use information regarding your selected payment method provided by your issuing bank or applicable payment system. If you pay with foreign currency, you agree that the amount you are eventually credited may vary, as a result of foreign currency conversion policies of our third party payment processors, which you can find at the relevant website or location where you make the actual purchase.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">9.2 If you do not use your LocoChat Credit for a period of six months (including LocoChat Credit that has been allocated to you by a LocoChat administrator), such credits will be frozen. You can reactivate the LocoChat Credit by accessing your LocoChat-Out account on <a href="http://viber.com/"><span class="s4">LocoChat.com</span></a>, and following the instructions therein. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">9.4 Automatic Recurring Charge. The recurring charge feature will be automatically enabled when you buy LocoChat Credit through the LocoChat website, unless you uncheck the appropriate checkbox at the time of purchase. Your LocoChat Credit balance will be recharged with the same amount and by the same payment method you initially designated when you registered your account every time your LocoChat account balance goes below the threshold set by LocoChat from time to time. You can disable the recurring charge feature at any time by accessing your User Account. Any charges mentioned in specific currencies are solely considered as examples, and do not take currency fluctuations or discrepancies into account.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">10.2 LocoChat reserves the right to refuse a refund request if it reasonably believes or suspects (i) that you are trying to unfairly exploit this refund policy, for example, by making repetitive refund requests in respect of the same product or feature; (ii) that you are in breach of the terms of this License; (iii) that you are using any of our products fraudulently or that your User Account is being used by a third party fraudulently; or (iv) that you purchased your credit through a third party service and the terms of such third party do not allow such refund.

Choice of Law. To the extent permitted by law, and with the exception of Section 8 (which will be construed in accordance with the FAA and New York law), these Terms shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, as they are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within New York.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">32. Binding Arbitration of All Disputes; No Class Relief.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This section sets forth the exclusive way you can resolve any dispute you may have with us. If you ever wish to seek any relief from us, you agree to do it only through arbitration, and you waive the ability to pursue class action.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">(a) U.S. Residents: To the fullest extent permissible by law, with the exception of disputes pertaining to LocoChat’s intellectual property rights and certain statutory claims that, pursuant to law, are not arbitrable, any dispute of any kind between you and LocoChat arising under these Terms shall be resolved through binding arbitration pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures on an individual basis with no class relief. The arbitrator shall be a retired judge or justice of any New York state or federal court with substantial experience in the internet industry and shall follow New York substantive law in adjudicating the dispute, except that this Section 8(a) shall be construed as a “written agreement to arbitrate” pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). You and we agree that we intend that this Section 8(a) satisfies the “writing” requirement of the FAA. The hearing shall be conducted in the county that encompasses the billing address you have provided to LocoChat. For any claim in which you seek U.S. $10,000.00 or less, you shall have the choice as to whether the hearing is conducted in person, by telephone, or instead the arbitrator may decide the dispute without a hearing. For those claims that the arbitrator determines are not frivolous, LocoChat shall pay the costs and fees of JAMS and the arbitrator. LocoChat agrees that it will not seek reimbursement from you for its costs and fees incurred by it in the arbitration. AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND A WAIVER OF THE ABILITY TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN A CLASS ACTION.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">(b) Non-U.S. Residents: If any controversy, allegation, or claim (including any non-contractual claim) arises out of or relates to the Service or the Terms (a “Section 8(b) Dispute”), then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Section 8(b) Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us. But if no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Section 8(b).  Your notice to us must be sent to us at <a href="mailto:Viberforeigndispute@viber.com"><span class="s4">LocoChatforeigndispute@LocoChat.com</span></a>. For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, LocoChat and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Section 8(b) Dispute, though nothing will require either you or LocoChat to resolve the Section 8(b) Dispute on terms which either you or LocoChat, in each of our sole discretion, are uncomfortable with.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If your Section 8(b) dispute against LocoChat involves a paid LocoChat Service and we are unable to resolve it through dialogue (as described above), LocoChat will Directive 2013/11/EU on Consumer Alternative Dispute Resolution.
